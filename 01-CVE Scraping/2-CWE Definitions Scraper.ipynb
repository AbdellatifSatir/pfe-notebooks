       "2         The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using      externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not sanitize      or incorrectly sanitizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL      command when it is sent to a downstream component.Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable       inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as       SQL instead of ordinary user data. This can be used to alter query logic to       bypass security checks, or to insert additional statements that modify the       back-end database, possibly including execution of system commands.      \n",

This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended       input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a       resource, or arbitrary code execution.      \n",
